            <h2>"Don't Get Upset, Brother!</h2>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <p>Player 1: Blue</p>
            <p>Player 2: Red</p>
            <p>The goal is to bring all your pieces to their respective "homes."</p>
            <p>Roll the dice and click the piece you want to move.</p>
            <p>There's a catch: If you want to move your piece out of it's starting position, you'll have to roll a 6 first.</p>
            <p>And, whenever you roll a 6, you are given the chance to roll again!!</p>
            <p>If you happen to land on an opposing piece, you will knock them back to their starting position!</p>
            <h2>REMEMBER:</h2>
            <h2>You will lose your turn if:</h2>
            <p>You try to move your piece onto another of your own</p>
            <p>You try to move your piece out of the starting position without first rolling a 6</p>
